Please report only real bugs here.

If you have trouble setting up Nodemailer then the best place to look for help would be the documentation https://nodemailer.com/

If you still can't manage it out by yourself, then asking help in Stack Overflow probably works https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=nodemailer

Issues that can not be reproduced are closed by default, so make sure you include enough information that helps to verify the bug. Including version numbers of affected system (operating system, node version, nodemailer version) helps a lot. A stack trace would be great. And a self contained script that demonstrates the bug would be the best. If you need a working email account for the demo script, then use https://ethereal.email/
